# My DIY Thermostat

Using some off the shelf parts a 3D printer to make an OK thermostat

#Major Changes

Using a diffrent temprature sensor
Using a relay interlock so the heat and cool can never be on at the same time
Made the push in on the encoder more featurefull
Relay board included inside the enclosure

#Problems

DST22 temprature sensor has wildly high readings
Needs fine adjustment on the start and stop time

#Todo

I would like it to take in account:
    other temprature sensors in the house
    time of day
    outside temprature
    humidity
    barametic preasure
    house ocupency
